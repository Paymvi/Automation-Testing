## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure that the software is both functional and secure is by testing that piece of software. The tests should be made to check if the code meets all the functional and non functional requirements, and that no issues or insecurities are present within the code. It should be tested again through multiple different methods to ensure the overall program is working and so are the inner parts.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To incorporate user needs into a program, one must (or a team must) brainstorm requirements that the project must fulfill in order to meet user needs. In short, from the user needs, people need to make requirements and by building the code and teseting by those requirements, people can tell whether or not the project is meeting user needs.
For example, if a user need is to filter out items from a list that are out of budget, a requirement should be made that specificallly addresses that user need, and then it should be tested.

## How do I approach designing software?
To design software, first it is important to figure out what are the requirements (functional and non function requirements) of that software. Then code should be made carefully (based off of the requirements) and prefereably should be tested often within the development phase. When designing software it is important to keep the overall goal (of the project) in mind, to allow for flexbility to maybe approach making the software a different (mbut more efficient way).
